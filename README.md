hackerrank: 1005 pts.

total: 33 problems solved

problems are mostly taken from hard and medium difficulty

uploaded codes are changed for ability to test (added main functions and return values) 

INPUT for tests is read from stdin.

OUTPUT (since it is recommended not to read from files during testing) is taken just from return values of functions. Thus, the code for some problems was rewritten.
